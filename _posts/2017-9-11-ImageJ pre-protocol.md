# The following mini protocols allowed me to craft a final protocol for using ImageJ to measure coral eggs

***Set scale for each picture (in ImageJ)***
		* Find scale in bottom right corner
		* Use line tool and trace the scale
		* Go to top menu
			* -> analyze -> set scale...
		* Set scale to desired number
		
***ImageJ (general)***
		* file -> open or open next; select image
		* stamp each egg;
			* text box -> type number
			* press "command D" to stamp it
		* measure diameter of eggs:
			* use line tool
			* select start / end point across egg 
			* press "command m" to save data to table
		* move data into excel sheet
