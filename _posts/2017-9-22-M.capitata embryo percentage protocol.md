The following protocol can be used for acquiring embryo samples before calculating their life stage proportions 


1.	On a flatwork area, set up a black paper underneath the microscope camera.

2.	Place a six-welled petri dish cover on the black paper.

3.	Use a transfer pipette and disposable pipette tip, add one drop from the sample tube. 
	a.	If the larvae do not appear to be coming out or get stuck to the side of the tube, add distilled sea water to the tube to dislodge the larvae. 
	
4.	Let the embryos sit for 30 seconds in order to separate from the water.

5.	Use the transfer pipette to remove any excess water. 

6.	Count embryos until there at least 20 embryos.

a.	If there is not, go back to the sample tube and get another drop of embryos.

7.	Using the smartphone camera mounted on the microscope, take picture of embryo sample.

8.	Using the transfer pipette, return the embryos to the sample tube.

9.	Dispose of pipette tip.

10.	Use paper towel to wipe off petri dish. 

11.	Repeat steps 3 â€“ 10 until enough sample pictures have been taken.

12.	In an Microsoft Excel CSV spreadsheet, enter in number of embryos at specific developmental stages, and calculate their percentages.
