I'm an undergraduate Marine Biology major at the University of Rhode Island, currently working in the Putnam Laboratory. Coral reef ecology, coral development and physiology, ocean acidification, and marine ecology are the main topics of my interest and research. I am specifically interested in the affects of increasing ocean acidity on coral embryos and their development. I enjoy world travel, SCUBA diving, tennis, and photography.
