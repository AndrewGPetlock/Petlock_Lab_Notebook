I'm an undergraduate Marine Biology major at the University of Rhode Island, currently working in the Putnam Laboratory. My main topics of my interest and research include coral reef ecology, coral development and physiology, ocean acidification, and marine ecology. I am specifically interested in the affects of increasing ocean acidity on coral embryos and their development. I enjoy world travel, SCUBA diving, tennis, and photography.

### Positions Held

| Time   | Position | Affiliation | Accomplished |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| September 2017 – present| Intern | URI Dept. of Biological Sciences, Kingston RI | Currently continuing to develop R programming skills by making the code for a protein standard curve analysis, along with learning new protocols, real time data analysis, and coral husbandry skills in preparation for upcoming field work. Worked on counting life stages of M. capitata coral embryos, and learning the R statistical programming language in order to analyze the effects of changing pH on the embryos. 
|July – August 2017  | Ecology Director | BSA Camp Resolute, Bolton, MA | At the Ecology Center, I  maintained animal terrariums and updated of class records & supply inventories. Taught Boy Scout merit badges in Environmental Science, Chemistry, Mammal and Insect Study to scouts ages 11-17. Greeted camp visitors, answered questions, and oversaw camp sign-in sheets. Also assisted with camp waterfront operations, to ensure the safety of all swimmers. |
|June - July 2015 | Intern | URI Dept. of Fisheries, Animal, and Veterinary Science, Kingston, RI | Worked on:  Sea Star Wasting Syndrome project - ran RT-PCR to determine viral load within tissues of affected sea stars; then tasked with developing a new protocol to grow sea star tissue within Microtissues Natural 3D Molds, to try to keep the cells alive long enough to allow virus to develop within them; and also assisted in development of a new probiotic to introduce into shellfish hatcheries, to prevent marine pathogens from killing shellfish larvae.
